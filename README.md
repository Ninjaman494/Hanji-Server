Node.js server used by the Android app [Hanji](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a494studios.koreanconjugator&hl=en_US&gl=US). 

## Conjugation

Conjugation is done based on the algorithm built by [Dan Bravender](https://github.com/dbravender). While the original repo is now longer available, a good reproduction of it can be found [here](https://github.com/Ninjaman494/Hanji-Server/tree/v1.0.0/korean).
